# BOSH - Getting Started on AWS

This repository is now historical. It is legacy. It was the first tutorial written in 2012 to help other people get started with BOSH.

OMG BOSH has grown up. It is so much easier to get started these days than ever before. And there is maintained documentation and bootstrapping repos.

* https://bosh.cloudfoundry.org/docs - all the documentation that didn't exist in 2012
* https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-deployment - bootstrap BOSH on half a dozen infrastructures.
