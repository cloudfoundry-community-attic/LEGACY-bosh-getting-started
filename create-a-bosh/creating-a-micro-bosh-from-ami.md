# Create a Micro BOSH from AWS AMI

STATUS: Being updated based on [Martin's blog post](http://blog.cloudfoundry.org/2012/09/06/deploying-to-aws-using-cloud-foundry-bosh/ "Deploying to AWS Using Cloud Foundry BOSH | CloudFoundry.org Blog").

This tutorial shows you how to create your first BOSH on AWS using an existing AMI. This is one of several tutorials for [creating a BOSH](creating-a-bosh-overview.md).

In BOSH terminology, you will be creating a Micro BOSH. You will provision a single VM that contains all the parts of BOSH, which is bootstrapped from a pre-baked AWS AMI. That is, the AMI contains all the software packages required to run BOSH. 

[Why can't I just boot the AWS AMI and start using BOSH?](#why-cant-i-just-boot-the-aws-ami-and-start-using-bosh)

This tutorial will take you through the steps related to preparation, creating the configuration file and using the BOSH CLI to deploy the Micro BOSH VM.

## What will happen in this tutorial

There are three machines/VM being referenced in this tutorial. In addition to your local machine, we will create two VMs in the same AWS region:

1. Local machine - use fog to provision Inception VM; use ssh to access/prepare Inception VM
1. Inception VM - prepare an available Ubuntu VM; we'll create a new one
1. Micro BOSH VM - use BOSH CLI to bootstrap a new VM that is a BOSH (called "Micro BOSH")

That is, by the end of this tutorial you will have two Ubuntu VMs. An Inception VM used to create a BOSH VM.

NOTE, the BOSH VM must be in the same IaaS/region as the public image. In this tutorial it is an AWS AMI in the us-east-1 region (Virginia, the one that has all the public outages).

The Inception VM is used to:

* run a registry of AWS to track provisioned components in AWS
* store a registry of deployed Micro BOSHes
* store log files of BOSH CLI interactions with each Micro BOSH
* create a private AMI from a generic micro BOSH stemcell (not in this tutorial, only when [deploying a Micro BOSH from a stemcell in another tutorial](creating-a-micro-bosh-from-stemcell.md))

[/sidebar]

## Create the Inception VM

We will use fog to create the first Ubuntu VM on AWS. You could alternately create one any way that you want. In the next section we will prepare the VM with all the packages and source required for deploying a BOSH VM.

TODO: When using Micro BOSH AMIs, can the Inception VM be in a different region from where the BOSH VMs will be provisioned?

### Setup

In this tutorial we're going to use a command-line program called [fog](http://fog.io) to create our Inception VM, and then later on for provisioning an elastic IP address for the BOSH VM.

Three setup steps to run on your local machine:

1. Create SSH keys
1. Install fog
1. Create `.fog` credentials file (with your [AWS API credentials](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/securityCredentials))

If you've never created SSH keys before, run the following command to create `~/.ssh/id_rsa` and `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` files:

```
$ ssh-keygen
```


Install latest version of fog as a RubyGem:

```
gem install fog
```

Example `~/.fog` credentials:

```
:default:
  :aws_access_key_id:     PERSONAL_ACCESS_KEY
  :aws_secret_access_key: PERSONAL_SECRET
```

### Boot Ubuntu instance

From Wesley's [fog blog post](http://www.engineyard.com/blog/2011/spinning-up-cloud-compute-instances/ "Spinning Up Cloud Compute Instances | Engine Yard Blog"), boot a vanilla Ubuntu 64-bit image in `us-east-1` region.

``` ruby
$ fog
  Welcome to fog interactive!
  :default provides AWS and VirtualBox
connection = Fog::Compute.new({ :provider => 'AWS', :region => 'us-east-1' })
server = connection.servers.bootstrap({
  :public_key_path => '~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub',
  :private_key_path => '~/.ssh/id_rsa',
  :flavor_id => 'm1.small',
  :bits => 64,
  :username => 'ubuntu'
})
```

You can check that SSH key credentials are setup. The following should return "ubuntu" and shouldn't timeout.

```
server.ssh("whoami").first.stdout
"ubuntu"
```

Now create an elastic IP and associate it with the instance.

``` ruby
address = connection.addresses.create
address.server = server
server.reload
server.dns_name
"ec2-10-9-8-7.compute-1.amazonaws.com"
```

This DNS name will be used later to SSH into our Inception VM.

The security group for the Inception & BOSH VMs will need some TCP ports opened:

``` ruby
connection.security_groups.create name: "microbosh", description: "microboshes"
group = connection.security_groups.get("microbosh")
group.authorize_port_range(25555..25555) # BOSH Director API
group.authorize_port_range(6868..6868)   # Message Bus
group.authorize_port_range(25888..25888) # AWS Registry API
group.authorize_port_range(22..22)       # SSH access
```

Our Inception VM will store the configuration and deployment details of our Micro BOSH VMs. So we want to ensure all data is persistent beyond the lifespan of the Inception VM itself. In AWS, we use EBS volumes. We will construct the Inception VM in the manner that BOSH itself constructs VMs and attach a volume at the `/var/vcap/store` mount point.


``` ruby
# Create/attach a volume at /dev/sdi (or somewhere free)
volume = connection.volumes.create(:size => 5, :device => "/dev/sdi", :availability_zone => server.availability_zone)
volume.server = server

# Format and mount the volume
server.ssh(['sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdi -F']) 
server.ssh(['sudo mkdir -p /var/vcap/store'])
server.ssh(['sudo mount /dev/sdi /var/vcap/store'])
```

NOTE: If you get `Errno::ETIMEDOUT: Operation timed out - connect(2)` errors, please create a ticket to let me know. I get them sometimes. You can also run these shell commands directly from within the SSH session later.

You can now view the mounted 5G volume at `/var/vcap/store`

```
>> puts server.ssh(['df']).first.stdout

```

## Preparation

We now need to prepare our Ubuntu VM with the source code to be able to run the Micro BOSH deployment command.

These steps come from the [BOSH documentation](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/oss-docs/blob/master/bosh/documentation/documentation.md#bosh-deployer).

```
$ ssh ubuntu@ec2-10-9-8-7.compute-1.amazonaws.com
sudo su -

export ORIGUSER=ubuntu
curl https://raw.github.com/drnic/bosh-getting-started/master/scripts/prepare_inception.sh | bash
source /etc/profile
```

After this script prepares the inception VM, it will display the help information for `bosh micro` CLI commands:

```
$ bosh help micro
micro deploy <stemcell>   Deploy a micro BOSH instance to the currently 
                          selected deployment 
                          --update   update existing instance 
micro delete              Delete micro BOSH instance (including 
                          persistent disk) 
micro deployment [<name>] Choose micro deployment to work with 
micro agent <args>        Send agent messages 
micro apply <spec>        Apply spec 
micro status              Display micro BOSH deployment status 
micro deployments         Show the list of deployments 
```

## Deployment configuration

Each Micro BOSH that you create will be described by a single YAML configuration file, commonly named `micro_bosh.yml`. This allows you to easily reference different Micro BOSH deployments, boot them, change them, and delete them.

We will store them all in `/var/vcap/deployments` (created by `prepare_inception.sh`)

```
cd /var/vcap/deployments
```

**Why have more than one MicroBOSH?** Each BOSH can only manage a single target infrastructure account and region. That is, if you want to use BOSH for multiple infrastructures (AWS, Rackspace, local vSphere), with different billing accounts, in different regions (AWS us-east-1, AWS us-west-2) then you will need a different BOSH for each permutation.

A simple convention for storing different `micro_bosh.yml` within our deployments folder could be to have folders named for the infrastructure/region:

```
# NOTE: only an example; you don't have any micro_bosh.yml files yet
$ find . -name micro_bosh.yml
  ./microbosh-aws-us-east-1/micro_bosh.yml
  ./microbosh-aws-us-west-2/micro_bosh.yml
```

**Where do I provision/host each Micro BOSH?** As above, each BOSH can manage VMs, persistant disk volumes and network associations in a single infrastructure region and account. That does not mean that the BOSH must be hosted within that same infrastructure/account. 

1. You could host all your BOSH deployments in the same region/account, with each one referencing external region/accounts.
1. You could host each BOSH deployment in the region/account that it will be managing.

For this tutorial, we will do option 2 and host the BOSH deployments within the same region/account that they will be managing. We will use the same AWS credentials used to create the first Ubuntu VM, but will deploy to a different region (although we could deploy to the same region; remember, each region requires a new BOSH deployment).

On your local machine using fog, provision an elastic public IP in the target infrastructure/region (us-west-2 in this tutorial):

``` ruby
connection = Fog::Compute.new({ :provider => 'AWS', :region => 'us-east-1' })
address = connection.addresses.create
address.public_ip
"1.2.3.4"
```

The "1.2.3.4" value will replace `IPADDRESS` in the `micro_bosh.yml` below.

Back to the Inception VM... 

Create an AWS keypair and store the `.pem` file. Inside the Inception VM:

```
ACCESS_KEY=XXXXXX
SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YYYYYY
IP_ADDRESS=1.2.3.4
PASSWORD=somethingmemorable
curl https://raw.github.com/drnic/bosh-getting-started/master/scripts/create_keypair > /tmp/create_keypair
chmod 755 /tmp/create_keypair
/tmp/create_keypair aws $ACCESS_KEY $SECRET_ACCESS_KEY us-east-1 microbosh

curl https://raw.github.com/drnic/bosh-getting-started/master/scripts/create_micro_bosh_yml > /tmp/create_micro_bosh_yml
chmod 755 /tmp/create_micro_bosh_yml
/tmp/create_micro_bosh_yml microbosh-aws-us-east-1 aws $ACCESS_KEY $SECRET_ACCESS_KEY us-east-1 microbosh microbosh $IP_ADDRESS $PASSWORD
```

This will create a file `microbosh-aws-us-east-1/micro_bosh.yml` that looks as below with the ALLCAPS values filled in. `PASSWORD` above (e.g. 'abc123') will be replaced by the salted version.

```

      address: IPADDRESS
    nats:
      address: IPADDRESS
  properties:
    aws_registry:
      address: IPADDRESS
```

## Deployment

We now use the BOSH CLI, on the Inception VM, to deploy the Micro BOSH.

First, select which AMI is to be used to create the Micro BOSH.

```
$ MICROBOSH_AMI=ami-69dd6900
```

Where, `ami-69dd6900` comes from the list below (current as of writing) for "us-east-1":

```
Region            AMI
ap-northeast-1 -> ami-7656eb77
ap-southeast-1 -> ami-64d59436
eu-west-1      -> ami-874c4af3
sa-east-1      -> ami-6280597f
us-east-1      -> ami-69dd6900
us-west-1      -> ami-4f3e1a0a
us-west-2      -> ami-7ac7494a
```

1. Tell the BOSH CLI which Micro BOSH deployment "microbosh-aws-us-east-1" to work on
1. Deploy the deployment using a specific public AMI

```
$ cd /var/vcap/deployments
$ bosh micro deployment microbosh-aws-us-east-1
Deployment set to '/var/vcap/deployments/microbosh-aws-us-east-1/micro_bosh.yml'

$ bosh micro deploy $MICROBOSH_AMI
WARNING! Your target has been changed to `http://55.55.55.55:25555'!
Deployment set to '/var/vcap/deployments/microbosh-aws-us-east-1/micro_bosh.yml'
Deployed `microbosh-aws-us-east-1/micro_bosh.yml' to `http://1.2.3.4:25555', took 00:17:20 to complete
```

To run the `bosh micro deployment microbosh-aws-us-east-1` command you must be in a folder that itself contains a folder `microbosh-aws-us-east-1` that contains `micro-bosh.yml`. In our tutorial, we are in `/var/vcap/deployments` which contains `/var/vcap/deployments/microbosh-aws-us-east-1/micro-bosh.yml`.


## Administration

WARNING: There is a default admin user created with a default password "admin". Please change this password immediately.

```
$ bosh create user admin
Enter password: *****************

# or

$ bosh create user admin very-long-and-secure-passphrase
```

Or create a user with a different username. The original admin/admin user will be removed when the first user is created.

Then re-login

```
$ bosh login
Your username: admin
Enter password: *****************
Logged in as 'admin'
```

You can now create user accounts the same way.

## Destroy your Micro BOSH

You can delete a specific Micro BOSH deployment:

```
$ cd /var/vcap/deployments
$ bosh micro deployment microbosh-aws-us-east-1
$ bosh micro delete
```

## Questions

### Why can't I just boot the AWS AMI and start using BOSH?

Actually, you can. Martin Englund wrote a blog post [documenting this](http://blog.cloudfoundry.org/2012/09/06/deploying-to-aws-using-cloud-foundry-bosh/ "Deploying to AWS Using Cloud Foundry BOSH | CloudFoundry.org Blog").

This article can probably be shaved down substantially to be similar/same as Martin's article.
