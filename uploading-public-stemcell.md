# Getting a public stemcell and uploading it

A Stemcell is a VM template with an embedded bosh agent. They are the base image for new VMs. That is, on AWS they are the AMI.

Stemcells are large. 400Mb or more. So, run all the following commands from within your BOSH VM where it will be much faster to download and upload the stemcell to your BOSH.

```
$ ssh ubuntu@ec2-10-2-3-4.compute-1.amazonaws.com
sudo su -
gem install bosh_cli
bosh target localhost:25555
bosh public stemcells

```

You want the latest public AWS stemcell. Download it from the public server and then upload it to your BOSH:

```
$ cd /tmp
$ bosh download public stemcell bosh-stemcell-aws-0.6.2.tgz

BOSH knows about your uploaded stemcell (an AMI on AWS):

```
$ bosh stemcells

+---------------+---------+--------------+
| Name          | Version | CID          |
+---------------+---------+--------------+
| bosh-stemcell | 0.6.2   | ami-a213cbcb |
