# Getting a public stemcell and uploading it

Because its much faster, run all the following commands from within your BOSH VM.

```
$ gem install bosh_cli
$ bosh target ec2-23-23-203-54.compute-1.amazonaws.com:25555  # your BOSH's public/private URL
$ bosh public stemcells

BOSH knows about your uploaded stemcell (an AMI on AWS):

```
$ bosh stemcells

| Name          | Version | CID          |
+---------------+---------+--------------+
| bosh-stemcell | 0.5.1   | ami-a213cbcb |
